# Reference Implementation of SkipResNets

This repository presents a reference implementation of SkipResNets.
SkipResNet models are implemented as models for PyTorch Image Models (timm).
You can use the SkipResNet models for not only image classification tasks but also other downstream stask such as object detection or semantic segmentation.

See [evaluation results](https://github.com/takedarts/skipresnet), if you would like know the performances of SkipResNets.
